# BYOND Rust Libraries

_Unofficial libraries for handling [BYOND](http://byond.com) data_

## Goals

The intent of this project is to create fast, useful libraries for working with
[BYOND](http://byond.com). This could include file formats, network protocols,
parsing the DM programming language, and more.

This is an early-stage project, and may take some time to evolve into something
useful.
